# Minimax Algorithm 
* A common algorithm for two-player AI games. 
* Mini: minimizing. 
* Max: maximizing. 
* One player tries to maximize their score (this is the human that starts by default assumption), and the other player (the computer that follows and interprets the data), tries to minimize the first player's possible future total scores.
