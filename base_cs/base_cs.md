- _Binary_: You count with two digits! 
- No matter number of digits, _counting_ functions the same: you increment digits in one place until you can't any more, and then add a digit to the next place 
- _Converting_ from integers to binary: Which power of two can I reach without going over the number I want to convert? Subtract, repeat, until left with 0. 
- On is 1, and Off is 0. 
- _Bit_: A single digit in binary 
- _Byte_: 8 bits 
- _Computer word_: Number of bits a computer can process at a time
