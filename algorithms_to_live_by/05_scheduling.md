# Scheduling 

#### Getting things done 
- To find the shortest processing time, weight each task by the time it takes to finish, e.g. (task / length to finish), and then work in order from the highest resulting importance per unit time 

#### Thrashing 
- Threading 
- Interrupt coalescing, do one thing at a time (e.g. email once per day)
