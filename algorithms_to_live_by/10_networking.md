# Networking 

- TCP 
- Packet switching 
- Online, packet delivery is confirmed by what are called ACKs, or acknowledgement packets. These are critical to the functioning of the network (210) --> communication on servers 
- Exponential backoff: finite patience, infinite memory (helpful in arguments with parents)
- TCP congestion control algorithm: Additive, Increase, Multiplicative Decrease 
- Bufferbloat and the crepe line 
- Tail drop 
- Dropped balls as overload 
- FOMO bufferbloat
