# Algorithms to live by 
## The Computer Science of human decisions 
### Notes on a book by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths 

After a person I admire recommended this book to me, I immediately placed it on hold at my local library. Of course, living in San Francisco, my copy came with instructions for a Ritual Chemex device used as a bookmark. 

#### Introduction 
Get excited! This book will talk about how famous computer science algorithms have practical life applications.
