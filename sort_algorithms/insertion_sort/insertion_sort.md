### Insertion sort 
#### What is insertion sort? 

#### Visual 
You're sorting a bookshelf. You take every book off the shelf. You put the first book back in the middle of the shelf, then take the second and compare it to the first, inserting it either to the right or to the left. 

#### Big O
You still have to do an insertion for each book, and each insertion involves moving about half of the books on the shelf.
